# Announcements

This repo is for CoreWCF announcements only. To file a bug or start a discussion, please create a new issue in the [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF) repo.

All items posted to this repo are locked, but will typically have links to separate discussion threads in the [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF) repo. Please use those discussion threads for questions and comments about a particular announcement.

## Process

Since this repository is for announcements only, we do not accept issues or PRs on this repository. Furthermore, we'll usually not close any issues either. We will, however, close issues that have become invalid as we changed our mind and didn't end up implementing or shipping it.

Not closing issues has the following advantages:

* You can distinguish between what's not true (retracted) and what's just old
* You can easily search the announcements and filter without having to consider closed issues
